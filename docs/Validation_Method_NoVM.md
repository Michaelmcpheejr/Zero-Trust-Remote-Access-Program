# Validation Method — No VM

This assessment validates Zero Trust control intent and failure modes without deploying production workloads.

Validation methods include:
- Configuration review (NSGs, routing tables, subnet associations)
- Azure Activity Log review for change events
- Architecture diagrams representing intended, failed, and remediated states

This approach aligns with common audit and governance validation practices when direct workload testing is constrained.
