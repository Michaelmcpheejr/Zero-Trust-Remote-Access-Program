# Scope & Assumptions

## In Scope
- Azure administrative control plane access
- Network routing and boundary enforcement
- Zero Trust brokered access model
- Privileged access governance
- Logging and monitoring expectations (Splunk conceptual)

## Out of Scope
- Application source code
- Physical security controls
- Real FedRAMP authorization boundary
- Production tenant identifiers

## Key Assumptions
- All privileged access should be brokered through approved Zero Trust mechanisms
- Trusted network location alone is insufficient for authorization
- Routing and segmentation controls enforce access boundaries
- Monitoring and alerting support audit assurance
