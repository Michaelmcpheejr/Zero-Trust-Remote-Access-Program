# Executive Briefing — Zero Trust Remote Access Assessment

## Objective
Evaluate the effectiveness of Zero Trust remote access controls protecting privileged administrative access.

## Key Finding
A routing trust boundary bypass allowed privileged access to occur outside the approved Zero Trust brokered path.

## Risk Rating
Medium (pre-mitigation), reduced to Low (post-mitigation).

## Actions Taken
- Enforced routing and segmentation controls
- Strengthened privileged access governance expectations
- Defined monitoring and alerting requirements

## Outcome
Broker-only privileged access enforced with improved audit assurance and reduced likelihood of recurrence.
